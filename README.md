# Revisiting My First Data Analysis Notebook  

A few years have passed since I graduated, and I wanted to revisit one of the very first Jupyter notebooks I created while learning Python for data analysis.  

This repository is a small throwback project, where I:  
- Review and reflect on my early work.  
- Compile a set of basic data visualization and data analysis commands.  
- Practice improving the structure, readability, and clarity of the notebook.  

## Dataset  
The dataset comes from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) and is a great practice tool. It offers plenty of opportunities for:  
- Data cleaning and wrangling  
- Exploratory data analysis  
- Visualization with popular Python libraries  

## Purpose  
The goal of this repository is not just to showcase polished work but also to appreciate the learning journey:  
- **Then:** My initial attempt at analyzing data with Python.  
- **Now:** Revisiting and reflecting on what I could have done better with more experience.  

## Contents  
- `Billionaires_database.ipynb`: Original (revisited) Jupyter notebook  
- Data visualization examples using:  
  - **pandas** for data manipulation  
  - **matplotlib** and **plotly.express** for visualization  

## Why This Repo?  
- A bit of history from my data science journey üìñ  
- A handy place to keep basic visualization snippets and workflows  
- A reminder that growth comes from practice and reflection üöÄ

üìù *This repository will stay light and simple. Over time, I may revisit the dataset with new approaches as a way to track progress.*
